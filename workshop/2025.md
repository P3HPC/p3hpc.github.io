# Overview

The topic of Performance, Portability, and Productivity (P3) focuses on
enabling applications and libraries to run across multiple architectures
without significant impact on achieved performance and with the goal of
maintaining developer productivity. The International Workshop on Performance,
Portability, and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) provides a forum for researchers
and developers to discuss their successes and failures in tackling the
compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance, portability
and productivity (P3) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). This workshop aims
to bring together developers and researchers with an interest in practical
solutions, technologies, tools, and methodologies that enable the development
of performance-portable applications across a diverse set of current and future
highâ€‘performance computers. The P3HPC topic touches on many aspects of HPC
software development and the workshop program is expected to reflect a wide
range of experiences and perspectives, including those of compiler, language
and runtime experts; applications developers, performance engineers; and domain
scientists.

Further information on the scope and expectations for P3HPC submissions may be
found [here](https://p3hpc.org/principles/).

# Topics of Interest

Authors are invited to submit novel research from all areas concerned with
performance, portability, and productivity.  Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

- Measuring and evaluating the success of P3 approaches with applications, proxy-apps, or benchmarks
- Portability oriented HPC languages, programming models, directives, libraries, domain-specific languages, runtimes, or other abstractions
- Case studies using state-of-the-art P3 tools and techniques (successes and failures)
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- P3 in AI, and applying AI to P3
- Techniques specifically designed for use with legacy codes
- Impact of increasing complexity of workflows on P3 analysis
- Preparing portable applications for future architectural and system changes, e.g. edge, federation
- Future-proofing applications through an era of increased heterogeneity and new emerging architectures
