# [GPU Programming Model Compatibility Overview](https://x-dev.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/models/)

<a href="https://x-dev.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/models"><img class="resource-teaser" src='/assets/img/compat-matrix.png' /></a>This project tracks the support of different programming models across different GPU architectures, and presents the results in a concise table. A first version was presented at [P3HPC 23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3624178?cid=99659740494), and the project is updated since then [on the website](https://x-dev.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/models/). With a rapidly changing landscape, it’s hard to keep track of all the advances – the table gives an overview, but if you are aware of new or outdated information, Andreas is relying on your help over [at the GitHub repo of the project](https://github.com/AndiH/gpu-lang-compat).
